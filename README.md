# LambdaTestSeleniumAdvanced
This is a repository containing the Final assessment for the LambdaTest Selenium Advanced Certification.

## Testting Framework
The Tests are written using the Pytest Framework.

## Libraries to be installed for the execution
1. pytest
2. selenium
3. pytest-xdist
The same have been configured in the *gitpod.yml*.

## Note:
All options required for running the tests have been added in the pytest.ini file
Hence we see no parameters passed during execution of the tests as seen in the gitpod.yml file

* Number of workers for parallel execution are currently set to 2
